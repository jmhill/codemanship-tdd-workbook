# TDD Workbook Sample Solutions

A collection of code created as exercise solutions and annotated examples
for Jason Gorman's TDD workshop book (generously provided for free at
[the codemanship 'free stuff' page](https://codemanship.co.uk/papers.html))

## Tooling Choices

Gorman uses Java and a mostly Object-Oriented approach in the TDD
workshop; for these implementations I've elected to use Typescript
(via Deno) to provide examples of more "functional light" approaches.

Deno provides built-in support for their own test runner and associated
testing utilities (BDD-style assertions, mock objects). See the Deno
docs for information about these libs.

The development environment is provided via devbox/nix.

Run `deno test` to run all tests.
